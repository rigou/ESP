/* This is an example of a transmit function in a generic
   peripheral driver. An RTOS task calls the transmit function,
   then waits in the Blocked state (so not using an CPU time)
   until it is notified that the transmission is complete. The
   transmission is performed by a DMA, and the DMA end interrupt
   is used to notify the task.
